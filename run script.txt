jmeter -n -t test.jmx -l test.jtl


This will run the JMeter test contained in the file test.jmx and save the results to the file test.jtl. The -n flag specifies that JMeter should run in "non-GUI" mode, which means that it will not open the JMeter GUI window.

You can also specify various other options when running JMeter from the command line. For example, you can use the -J flag to set a JMeter property, or the -H and -P flags to specify a proxy server.

For more information on running JMeter from the command line, you can refer to the JMeter documentation or use the jmeter -h command to view a list of available options.
